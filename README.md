# MyERC20

## Why it exists
The original goal was to learn more Solidity and smart contract development. Without some way to interact with the contract, I had no nice way to show it worked. Because I also have interest in becoming a Dapp developer, I decided to use this oppurtunity to learn web development and hook up a web client. 

I completed the following in this application:
 
 - Native implementation of the [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token interface.
   - Learned more about Solidity, the true nature and purpose of tokens, and how to implement more financial-related contracts
   - Learned to create a factory contract to manage token creation and provide an interaction layer to the web app
 - Wrote a web application
   - Learned CSS basics, HTML basics, Javascript, [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
   - Became more comfortable with connecting to web3 via MetaMask
   - Bettered my project architecture skills
   
## What it does
This application provides very basic token management services:

- Create new [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) tokens
- Perform all [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)-sanctioned methods

## Run
You'll need 
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) connection to the Rinkeby test network
  
To run, download and do the following in a terminal:

* `cd MyERC20`
* `npm install`
* Ensure [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is installed
* `npm run start`
